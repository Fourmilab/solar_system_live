Checking the &ldquo;Stereo&rdquo; box causes Solar System Live to create a
<em>stereo pair</em> of images, suitable (with a little practice) for
three-dimensional viewing of the Solar System.  Three-dimensional (3D)
views are particularly valuable when <a href="elements.html">tracking
asteroids and comets</a> in highly inclined orbits.

<h3>Viewing Stereo Images</h3>

<p class="j">
There are two basic techniques for viewing stereo pairs: one involves
a stereoscope (an optical device with lenses for both eyes which focus
different images on each), and the other is a mental trick called
<em>crossed eye fusion</em> which requires no hardware assistance.  The
images used by the two techniques are incompatible: when the images
are printed left to right, a stereoscope delivers the right image to
the right eye and the left image to the left eye.  The crossed eye
fusion technique reverses this, so in order to use a set of printed
images prepared for one technique with the other, it's necessary to
cut out the images and swap them left for right on the page.  With
computer-generated images it is easy to swap them, so Solar System
Live offers stereo pairs in both &ldquo;cross-eye&rdquo; and
&ldquo;wall-eye&rdquo; formats.
</p>

<p class="j">
Learning crossed eye fusion requires you to upload a small amount of
software into your brain.  About 80% of the population is able to
learn crossed eye fusion (about 92% can perceive stereo with the aid
of a stereoscope), but the technique requires some patience to learn.
Once learned, it's like riding a bicycle&mdash;you'll never forget it and
you can use it whenever you want without any conscious effort.
Some people who can't manage the crossed eye trick are able to fuse
stereoscope (wall-eye) images by directing their attention beyond the
screen until the two images fuse.  If you have trouble with the
crossed eye technique described below, you might want to give that a
try.
</p>

<p class="j">
To learn crossed eye fusion, you need to learn to decouple two
separate functions your brain usually links together: differential
lateral aim of the eyes and focusing of the lens.  Normally, as you
look at objects at different distances from your eye, two things
happen.  First, you adjust your eyes from fully parallel aim (to look
at an object at infinity) to extreme toe-in (to look at an object as
close as you can focus).  These two physiological functions are
completely independent, but the brain learns to couple them
because in normal viewing a given focus will always be correct for a
certain degree of eye-cross.
</p>

<p class="j">
The best way to learn crossed eye fusion is to start at a time when
you are well rested, relatively free of stress, and have ten minutes
to practice without distractions or noise.  (Did I just lose my
audience?)  Here's a small stereo pair to practice with.  The smaller
the image, the less you have to cross your eyes to bring the two frames
into alignment, so it's best to start out with smaller images when you're
learning.
</p>

<p class="j">
Before beginning, you might want to practice crossing and uncrossing
your eyes (gently, not to any extreme) and (if you can), focusing and
defocusing your eyes while staring at a distant object (such as a
picture on the wall in front of you).  If you have trouble doing this,
don't worry&mdash;the point is to get an idea what the two actions feel
like.
</p>

<p class="j">
Concentrate on picture pair, tilting your head until the two images
are dead-level with respect to one another.  Place your index finger
at the border between the two pictures with your fingertip at the
bottom of the pictures.  Now keep your attention on the fingertip as
you very slowly move it from the screen toward your nose.  Notice
what's happening to the two pictures on the screen: they're moving
together as you cross your eyes to track the fingertip.  Notice that
they are also going out of focus as your eye's lens adjusts to keep
your fingertip in focus.  When your finger is about 20 cm from your
nose (this will vary quite a bit based on your interocular separation
and the distance from your eyes to the screen), the two blurry images
in the background will merge with the left image overlapping the right
one.  At this point, you'll perceive <em>three</em> images: the left, the
fused combination of the left and right, and the right.  You might
want to practice this fusion several times by slowly moving your
finger back and forth from the screen to your nose as you observe the
action of the images you perceive.
</p>

<p class="j">
Now it's time to go for it.  Bring the images into fusion by focusing
on your fingertip and hold your attention on the fingertip for about
10 seconds.  Be sure the fingertip is below the merged image,
not overlapping it.  Now focus your attention on that merged image.
Tell your brain that a tiger may spring from it any second and that
you have to see it clearly.  As you shift your attention,  the lenses
of your eyes will refocus on the page while remaining crossed
correctly for viewing the finger.  The first few times you try this,
you'll probably &ldquo;lose it&rdquo; and the images will float away.  If as you
attempt to refocus the finger separates into two images, you've
probably got the finger too close or too near; when it's right, both
the finger and the merged image will stay single&mdash;the only change will
be them drifting in and out of focus.
</p>

<p class="j">
When you are able to focus on the merged images, slowly remove the
finger from the field of view and practice holding the fused images
together and in sharp focus.  If your head is not level, the two
images will fail to merge vertically: just tilt your head until they
come together.  After you've held the images together for a few
seconds (it takes 30 seconds for some people, especially when first
learning the technique), suddenly a datastorm traverses the
<em lang="la">corpus callosum</em> and Mars pops out of the screen and
Mercury peeks around the far side of the Sun.  After you've
become accustomed to crossed eye fusion, you'll be able to do it
instantly, on larger and more complicated images, without any need for
the finger-tracking trick.
