<h2>Orbit Plotting</h2>

<p class="j">
The orbits of the planets are not coplanar, and many comets and
asteroids have highly inclined orbits.  The <em>ecliptic</em> is
defined as the plane containing the Earth's orbit. With respect to
that plane, the other orbits are inclined and thus, in the course of
each revolution the planets rise above and fall below the plane of the
ecliptic.  The portion of the orbit above the plane of the ecliptic is
drawn in blue, the portion below in green.  Most planets' orbits are
only slightly inclined with regard to the ecliptic; notable exceptions
are Mercury, 7 degrees and Pluto, a whopping 17.2°.

<h2>Orbit Scales</h2>

<form method="post" action="/cgi-bin/Solar">
<center>
<b>Orbits:</b><label><input type="radio" name="orb" value="-b1" />&nbsp;Real</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="orb" value="-b0" checked="checked" />&nbsp;Logarithmic</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="orb" value="-b2" />&nbsp;Equal</label>
<br />
<input type="submit" value="Update" />
</center>

<p class="j">
Regardless of whether you're viewing just the inner planets or the
entire solar system, you can choose among three different scales for
the orbits.  The default, &ldquo;Logarithmic&rdquo;, shows the orbits
in a logarithmic scale which preserves their relative scale while
compressing the vast empty space of the outer system.  &ldquo;Real&rdquo; selects
a true linear scale which shows just how empty the solar system is; in
Real mode you really can't view the inner and outer system on the same
display, although specifying a larger <a href="size.html">image size</a> will
help a little.
</p>

<p class="j">
&ldquo;Equal&rdquo; chooses a presentation you may recall from your
elementary school <cite>Science Is Good</cite> textbook (assuming you're young
enough to remember elementary school yet old enough to remember when
Science <em>was</em> Good)&mdash;all the orbits are shown equally spaced from one
another (with a tip of the hat to the eccentricity of the orbits of
Mercury, Mars, and Pluto).  The Equal view isn't included entirely for
nostalgia; it's very useful for viewing the solar system as a whole
when, for example, you're interested in events such as conjunctions
(appulses) between Venus and Jupiter.  In Equal view the orbit of any
asteroid you're tracking will always be plotted between the orbits of
Mars and Jupiter, regardless of where the actual body orbits in the
Solar System.
