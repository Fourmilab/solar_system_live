    You can select one the following colour schemes for the orrery.
    Samples of each colour scheme are given below, along with a discussion
    of the applications to which it is suited.

    The default full colour scheme is easiest to view on computer
    monitors which support 256 (or more) colours.
    The portion of each orbit above the plane of the ecliptic is drawn
    in blue, the portion below in green.

    <h4 class="s">Colour on white background</h4>
<p class="j">
    If you're printing the orrery on a colour printer, you
    may prefer a white background, which uses less ink or toner and
    avoids the possibility of the black background bleeding into
    the orbits.

    <h4 class="s">Black on white background</h4>
<p class="j">
    If you're planning to print the orrery on a black and white
    printer, this is usually the best choice.  The white background
    allows you to write on the image and keeps the background from
    using up lots of ink or toner in your printer.  The portion of
    an orbit above the ecliptic is plotted in black, the portion
    below in grey.

    <h4 class="s">White on black background</h4>
<p class="j">
    Many astronomers find charts in white with a
    black background easier to read with the dim red flashlights
    they use at the telescope to preserve night vision.  You
    can produce orreries in this form, but if you're planning
    to print them, ponder the
    consequences for your printer.  All of that black has to come
    from somewhere, and that somewhere is generally your printer's
    ink or toner cartridge.  Making lots of white on black maps
    can use up cartridges at a prodigious rate compared to
    printing normal text.  Also, mostly black documents
    cause problems with some printers; laser printers may
    print a &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; on subsequent pages due to excess toner
    adhering to the imaging surface, and inkjet printers sometimes
    splatter ink around when feeding the large amount needed for
    extended regions of black.  Your printer may be immune from
    these foibles, but if it isn't, don't say I didn't warn you.
    The portion of
    an orbit above the ecliptic is plotted in white, the portion
    below in grey.

    If you're taking your laptop computer into the field to use
    at the telescope, this option may be just the ticket.  All
    items in the orrery are displayed in red, which doesn't tend
    to degrade night vision.  The portion of
    an orbit above the ecliptic is plotted in red, the portion
    below in dark red.
    When using this option, use the
    display brightness control to reduce the intensity to the
    minimum level at which you can still easily read the screen.
    Where possible, other material in the document is
    displayed red on black, like this paragraph.
