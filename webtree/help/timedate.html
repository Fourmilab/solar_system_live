<p class="j">
This set of controls select the time and date the image should
represent.  The default, <a name="Now">&ldquo;Now&rdquo;</a>, is the current time and date.
You can specify a date in the past or the future (from &minus;4712 [or 4713
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>] through <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 8000), as either a date and time in Universal
(Greenwich Mean) Time or by Julian Date.
</p>

<h3><a name="UTC">Universal Time</a></h3>

<p class="j">
To specify a date and time in Universal time, check the &ldquo;UTC&rdquo; box and
enter the date and time in the text field in the form:
</p>

<center>
<var>year-month-day hour:minute:second</var>
</center>

<p class="j">
If you omit <var>minute</var> or <var>second</var>, they're taken as
zero.  The entry in the example box above represents 22:00 (10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>)
Universal Time on September 17th, 1993, the date of the second approach of the
&ldquo;triple conjunction&rdquo; between Uranus and Neptune in that year.  Check
the UTC box and press &ldquo;Update&rdquo; and observe how Earth, Uranus, and
Neptune lined up at that moment.  Hold a ruler to your monitor and
note how precise the alignment was.
</p>

<p class="j">
If you're entering dates before <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1, note
that <cite>Solar System Live</cite> follows the astronomical convention where the
year historians call 1 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> is denoted
&ldquo;year 0&rdquo;, 2 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> &ldquo;year
&minus;1&rdquo;, and so on.  Thus, to  specify the year &ldquo;413
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>&rdquo; you would use
&ldquo;&minus;412&rdquo; in the Universal Time box.  See the
discussion below for more details, including the change-over from the
Julian to the Gregorian calendar in 1582.
</p>

<h3><a name="Julian">Julian Days</a></h3>

<p class="j">
The Gregorian calendar we use today is both exquisitely precise and
preposterously eccentric.  Astronomers who often work with events with
great regularity in time need to be able to calculate the difference
between two dates or when a particular phenomenon will recur in the
future without checking off boxes on a calendar.  The <dfn>Julian
day</dfn> system meets these needs.  A Julian date is simply the
number of days elapsed since the beginning of the year &minus;4712.  Since
optical astronomers of yore worked mostly by night, and observed
mostly from Europe, the Julian Day was defined to begin at noon, 12:00
Universal Time.  This avoided the inconvenience of having an observing
session begin one day and end the next, as would occur were
regular civil dates used.
</p>

<p class="j">
By starting so far in the past, all historical observations can be
expressed by positive Julian Day numbers.  Time is expressed by a
decimal fraction of days.  The Julian Day in the box above, 1719286.5,
corresponds to midnight, Universal Time, February 25, &minus;5.  Notice how
the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are close to being along a
straight line.  Indeed, at this moment, seen from Earth, a rare (not
to repeat for 800 years) conjunction among Jupiter (traditional king
of the gods), Saturn (ruling planet of Judah), and Mars, shown like a
beacon in the Western sky, in the constellation of Pisces the Fish
(the House of the Hebrews) where the equinox had just entered,
crossing the border from Aries where it had been since the Greeks.
Some people believe this was the Star of Bethlehem.  You'll recall
that the early Christians recognised one another with the sign of a
fish.
</p>

<p class="j">
You can enter any Julian date between 0.5 (January 1, &minus;4712) and
4346655.5 (December 31, 8000).  For Julian dates for years before
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1, note that astronomers and historians
use different conventions for those years.  In history books, the year
that preceded <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1  is called 1 <span
class="sc">B.C.</span>; zero not having come into use in European
culture at the time.  Astronomers consider the year before <span
class="sc">A.D.</span> 1 as &ldquo;year 0&rdquo;. Thus when an
astronomer talks about an eclipse having occurred in the year
&minus;412, that's the year historians refer to as &ldquo;413 <span
class="sc">B.C.</span>&rdquo;.  In converting Julian days to
historical dates, Solar System Live assumes the canonical date for the
<a href="/documents/calendar/IG_Latin.html"
   target="SolarSystemLiveAux">adoption of the Gregorian calendar</a>,
Friday, October 15th, 1582.  Many
countries shifted to the Gregorian calendar much later; in Great
Britain, not until 1752.  When investigating events in history, make
sure you express all dates after October 15th, 1582 in the Gregorian
calendar.
